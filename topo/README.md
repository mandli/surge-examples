# Bathymetry for Surge Examples

## Global Strip

Global strip of bathymetry for longitudes and latitudes [-180, 180]  x [-45, 45]
broken up in 15 degree horizontal strips.  Files are enumerated starting with
latitude -45.

strip_0.nc - [-45, -30]
strip_1.nc - [-30, -15]
strip_2.nc - [-15,   0]
strip_3.nc - [  0,  15]
strip_4.nc - [ 15,  30]
strip_5.nc - [ 30,  45]

## Mumbai

 - Indian Ocean: india.nc (47 W, 100 E, 31 N, -10 S) - ETOPO1 data fetched from
   https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/ on  Dec 15, 2016.
 - Mumbai area:  Conributed by Haider Hasan <haiderhasan@hotmail.co.uk> as part
   of a tsunami study.  Please contact him if you are interested in the
   bathymetry.  It is based on digitization of soundings and contours from
   nautical charts of the area, GEBCO data in the deeper water and SRTM data on
   land.
