# Synthetic Storm Examples

This directory contains a couple of examples where the storm and other
parameters are customized.  This includes creating a custom storm and custom
topography.

 - `boundary`: This example looks at the impact of a storm moving across a
   domain and through a boundary in a flat (meters) coordinate system.  It does
   allow for some simple, alternative boundary conditions and should be easy to
   implement others.  Also contains a Jupyter notebook and tools for looking at
   boundaries and storms.
 - `shelf`: Synthetic storm and topography using a simple coastal geometry and a
   slightly more complex artificial storm.
